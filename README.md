Our project, PalPack, is a solar powered hiking backpack equipped with a group finding GPS. There are four key components to our backpack: the Trail Trakker clips, flexible solar panel, USB ports, and diagnostic sensor. As the most notable feature of PalPack, the Trail Trakker locating clips offer a brand new navigational experience for every kind of hiker. Comprised of an Arduino Uno and a LoRa Bee radio communicator with GPS, the Trail Trakker is best utilized as a tracking device for locating any range of positions along a users hike. 

This repository contains code offering function to the Arduino Uno and LoRa Bee devices.
